### Challenges
* Using Formik in the registration form
* Persisting the user to be logged in when refreshing the page

### Lessons Learned
Past mistakes and also taking a look at other people's projects really made me grow and had me tweaking the way i do things to do better and improve as a developer. So what new things have i learned so far?
* Naming commit - How i name commits before was really meaningless or awful. Like any other developer who is getting started on this would name their commit as "Minor changes" or "Lot of changes" or whatever along these lines. I think i have improved by making descriptive messages when committing.
* File structure - There i still have struggled a lot with this, but at least i have worked my way through a little about naming my folders and files somewhere and there. I am still trying to improve. Before, i used to put all my files in one folder like 'src'. Now i have broken my files into section or folders.
* Transitioning to TypeScript - When beginning my projects, i began using JavaScript and then later finding myself switching my codebase to using TypeScript.
* Creating new branches - Something i have recently was using a good naming convention when creating a new branch. When sending a pull request for fixing an issue, i now use the issue number and the purpose of the issue. For example, when fixing the bug that is in issues i name the branch as 'fix/233-button-not-submitting'.
