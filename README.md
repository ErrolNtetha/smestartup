# Introduction
Startup project which for SMEs. It is still a long way to go and i hope to make the best effort to get a lot done and learn as i go. The website is build on ReactJS, and Vanilla CSS.

# What is it about?
It is aimed at connecting businesses that are looking to expand to new higher highs, and potential investors who look to take on new opportunities to diversify their portfolios. We aim to be the platform that has everything within one's reach. Security is at the forefront of our concerns as we make sure every business registering on the platform is legit and documents are viewed by the qualified people, and at your approval.

# A Note
This website is only mobile responsive. Still a under development.

# API
Website uses FakerJS NPM package to generate fake profile data. This will soon be replaced with real data profile once auntentication and authorization is complete.
