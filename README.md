# Overview
This project, **Blendot**, aims to be the platform for South Africans who are in business or has potential to become an entrepreneur. The platform helps businesses to create supplier profile and be discovered by other businesses in a case where they might need to switch from one supplier to another or when opening a new business and looking for new suppliers. It also enables people to find co-founders. This feature is for when you need to start a business and looking for business partners.

### Features
- Create posts
- Star (or like) other people's posts
- Browse suppliers
- Create supplier profile
- Search for co-founders

### Technologies Used
- ReactJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB
- NodeJS
- Redux
- Mongoose ORM
- SCSS

Used to React in the Frontend to develop interactive user interfaces.
For the backend i was using Node and Express with Mongoose ORM to manipulate data 
in MongoDB. 

### Mission
After a thorough research on business directories in South Africa, I have discovered that there are tons of directories of which most of them do not have enough features and not regularly maintained. I found that a lot of business directories are focused on all businesses as a whole which can be daunting for someone who is looking for a specific thing. My mission is to have a niche directory site which focuses on suppliers only, and to connect entreprenuers into one platform. The website focuses more on find manufacturing companies, wholesalers and distributors, importers etc.

### Challenges
* Committing to solving one problem at a time
* Naming of components and the project folder structure
* Getting rid of 403 error and refreshing the access token using the refresh token
* Using Formik creating a multi-step form in the registration form
* ...

### Lessons Learned
Past mistakes and also taking a look at other people's projects really made me grow and had me tweaking the way i do things to do better and improve as a developer. So what new things have i learned so far?
* Not to make big changes at a given time. Keep things small and seperate files at all times rather creating giant components with lots of lines of code.
* Naming commit - How i name commits before was really meaningless or awful. Like any other developer who is getting started on this would name their commit as "Minor changes" or "Lot of changes" or whatever along these lines. I think i have improved by making descriptive messages when committing.
* File structure - There i still have struggled a lot with this, but at least i have worked my way through a little about naming my folders and files somewhere and there. I am still trying to improve. Before, i used to put all my files in one folder like 'src'. Now i have broken my files into section or folders.
* Transitioning to TypeScript - When beginning my projects, i began using JavaScript and then later finding myself switching my codebase to using TypeScript. Although there is lot of learning i need to do with TypeScript.
* Creating new branches - Something i have learned recently was using a good naming convention when creating a new branch. When sending a pull request for fixing an issue, i now use the issue number and the purpose of the issue. For example, when fixing the bug that is in issues i name the branch as 'fix/233-button-not-submitting'.
